Scenario
International  Federation  for  IT  and  Travel  &  Tourism–IFITT(http://www.ifitt.org/)would like organize  a  series  of  
conferences  focusing  on  research  topics  in  the  area  of  travel and tourism.
As  a  part  of  their  operation,they  need  to organize annuallyconferences  for  researcher  and industry practitionersto meet,
present  about  their  work.You  are  appointed as  an  analyst programmer to develop asystem tosupport
theconferenceorganization of IFITT.  Your   task   is   to   investigate   the  operation  of appointedand   identify  
potential   events   or conferences  through  the  provided  link  or  any  other  resources  available online.  
You  will  design and  develop  a  conference  management  system  that  allows  conference  organizers  to  manage the  events  
and  registrations.    The  system  should  store  conference/event  details,  
organizers details for each conference, attendee details and their event registration. 
Model Design RequirementsYou are going to design a model to store data for your application with the following specification:
You have freedom to design your own data architecture and properties for the classes, however it should reflect your understanding
about complex entity relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and inheritance. 
The application shouldstore information forevery classes and relationship. Inheritance should be used to model classes with
similar property. For example, human being classes should have common properties are ID, Name, Contact details(email, phone, address,
etc...). Besides,each unique class should also have its own properties. You should provide justificationin your report on the proposed
classes, properties and their relationship are necessary. Appropriate data annotationand input validationshould be provided in the
model classes. You should customize your own error message, NOT to use thedefault error message provided by the template.Sample 
documentation is provided in SampleDocument.pdf file (VU collaborate) to help you with better understanding about how the application
should be implemented. But you must NOT follow the provided sample as it is not suitable specifically for the case in this assignm
